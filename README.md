Data abundance in the e-commerce industry have been heading up since digitalization from 2010’s.These data abundance are simply the user reviews in comment section in a text format.
So since the comment/review data is huge, nobody can sit and read all the comments to earn feed backs about the particu.ar product.
Sentiment Analysis (SA) is so used for, determining the positive, neutral and negative comments based upon Natural Language Processing (NPL)
If a customer/user post a comment like “This will be Apple’s best phone”, the “good” comment will be classified as positive comment and organization will improve the production in that domain.
If a customer/user post a comment like “Apple’s worst phone in software segment”, the “worst” comment will be classified as negative comment and the organization will rectify the product quality.
In this project, my aim is to develop and build a Machine learning model that analyzes millions of user comments (natural language) and provide a dedicated clustered result whether by it, a mangaer can understand the review overall is a good or a bad one.
The segments "Deep learning" and "SVM" in this projects are two branches, in which NLP could also done. The dedicated code and explanation has given in different repositories in my profile.
