Data abundance in the e-commerce industry has been increasing since digitalization from 2010s. This data abundance is simply the user reviews in the comment section in a text format. So since the comment/review data is huge, nobody can sit and read all the comments to earn feedback about the particular product. Sentiment Analysis (SA) is so used for, determining the positive, neutral and negative comments based upon Natural Language Processing (NPL) If a customer/user post a comment like “This will be Apple’s best phone”, the “good” comment will be classified as positive comment and organization will improve the production in that domain. If a customer/user posts a comment like “Apple’s worst phone in the software segment”, the “worst” comment will be classified as a negative comment, and the organization will rectify the product quality. In this project, I aim to develop and build a Machine learning model using a "tweets" dataset that analyzes thousands of user comments (natural language) and provides a dedicated clustered result, so that a manager can understand whether the review overall is a good or a bad one. The segments "Deep learning" and "SVM" in this project are two branches, in which NLP could also be done. The dedicated code and explanation have been given in different repositories in my profile.
